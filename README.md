# PheNoBo (Combining PHEnotype, GeNOtype and MetaBOtype)

This repository was created during the bioinformatics master practical (summer 2015) at Helmholtz Zentrum.
Originally, the repository contained Phenomizer for PhenoDis.

During summer 2016 Phenomizer for PhenoDis was further extended and included in PheNoBo.
PheNoBo is a set of KNIME nodes for predicting causal genes of rare diseases by combining phenotype, genotype and metabotype data.
As the PhenoDis database is not yet publicly available, you can test all KNIME nodes with the dummy data provided in this repository.

Content:

* MaPraNodes: source code of PheNoBo (including Phenomizer for PhenoDis)
* TestData: dummy data representing diseases, metabolites, genes and their associations among each other
* PhenomizerForPhenoDis: original implmentation and documentation of Phenomizer for PhenoDis
